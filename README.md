here i try to import this data into neo4j graph database to allow a more detailed discovery.

the process is explained in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/atomotic/anpi-facebook-neo4j/blob/master/italian%20fascism%20on%20facebook%20pages%20into%20neo4j.ipynb)
([bash_kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel) is required) or the [Makefile](https://github.com/atomotic/anpi-facebook-neo4j/blob/master/Makefile)
